# SG-Problem-1
Solutions for SG Problem 1

Solution 1 is a SQL only solution for Problem 1.  This was done in a MS SQL environment.  It creates its own dataset (the table 'People') and yields an answer.

Solution 2 is a C# only solution for Problem 1.  The only relevant file is default.aspx and its codebehind.  It also creates its own dataset, which is displayed.  Enter a desired size for the dataset and click the button to yield an answer.  I included all the solution files in case that's helpful.
